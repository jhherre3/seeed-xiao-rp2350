# Seeed Studio XIAO RP2350 ‚Äî CircuitPython Projects & Reference

Welcome to my project repo for the **Seeed Studio XIAO RP2350**, a thumb-sized but powerful MCU board built around the Raspberry Pi RP2350 chip. This repo contains **CircuitPython-based** demos, documentation, and projects I use for prototyping and experimentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why CircuitPython?

Although the XIAO RP2350 supports C/C++ and MicroPython, this repo focuses on **CircuitPython** due to:

- Rapid prototyping
- Built-in libraries for I2C, PWM, Display, Audio, etc.
- Easy USB drag-and-drop `.py` development
- Seamless integration with sensors and peripherals

> This board is ideal for quick CircuitPython projects using sensors, RGB control, displays, and low-power logic ‚Äî all in a compact footprint.

## üõ† Getting Started with CircuitPython

1. **Install CircuitPython**  
   Go to [https://circuitpython.org/board/xiao_rp2350/](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeeduino_xiao_rp2350/) and download the latest `.uf2` firmware.

2. **Flash the Board**
   - Hold the **BOOT** button while connecting via USB.
   - Drag the `.uf2` to the mounted volume (e.g. `RPI-RP2`)
   - It will remount as `CIRCUITPY`

3. **Edit Code**
   - Open the `code.py` file on `CIRCUITPY`
   - Write your CircuitPython logic
   - Save to run instantly!

4. **Install Libraries**
   - Download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
   - Copy only needed `.mpy` files or folders into the `lib/` folder on the board
